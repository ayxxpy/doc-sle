 <title>Administration by using transactional updates</title>
 <para>
 &slema; was designed to use the read-only root file system. So after the deployment is complete, you are not able to perform direct modifications to the root file system, e.g. by using <command>zypper</command>. The concept of transactional updates has been implemented to enable you to modify and keep your system up to date.
 </para>
 
 <para>
 Transactional updates key features are the following: 
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
 <listitem>
 <para>
 they are atomic - the update is applied only if it completes successfully.
 </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
 <para>
 changes are applied in a separate snapshot and thus they do not influence the running system.
 </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
 <para>
 they provide easy rollback.
 </para>
 </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 
 <para>
 Each time you call the <command>transactional-update</command> to change your system&mdash;either to install a package, perform an update or apply a patch; the following actions take place: 
 </para>
 <procedure>
 <title>Modifying the root file system</title>
 <step>
 <para>
 A new read-only snapshot is created from your current root file system.
 </para>
 </step>
 <step>
 <para>
 The snapshot is switched to the read-write mode.
 </para>
 </step>
 <step>
 <para>
 All changes are applied (update, patches or package installation).
 </para>
 </step>
 <step>
 <para>
 The snapshot is switched back to the read-only mode.
 </para>
 </step>
 <step>
 <para>
 A new root file system snapshot is created and the snapshots is prepared to be applied after reboot.
 </para>
 </step>
 <step>
 <para>
 After rebooting the new root file system is used instead of the current root file system.
 </para>
 <note>
 <para>
 Bear in mind that without rebooting your system, the changes won't be applied.
 </para>
 </note>
 </step>
 </procedure>
 
 <para>
 In case you do not reboot your machine before performing further changes to the file system, the new snapshot are created always from the current root. You will end up with several parallel snapshots, each spanshots includes the particular change, but not changes from the other snapshots. After reboot, the last created snapshot will be used as your current root file system and will not include changes done in the previous snapshots.
 </para>
 
 
 
 
 
 <section xml:id="sec-command-list">
 <title><command>transactional-update</command> usage</title>
 <para>
   The <command>transactional-update</command> command enables atomic installation 
   or removal of updates; updates are applied only
   if all of them can be successfully installed.
   <command>transactional-update</command> creates a snapshot of your system
   before the update is applied, and you can restore this snapshot. All changes become 
   active only after reboot.
  </para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><literal>--continue</literal></term>
   <listitem>
     <para>
         The <command>--continue</command> option is for making multiple changes to an
         existing snapshot without rebooting.
     </para>
     <para>
         The default <command>transactional-update</command> behavior 
         is to create a new snapshot from the current root file system. If you
         forget something, such as installing a new package, you have to reboot
         to apply your previous changes, run <command>transactional-update</command>
         again to install the forgotten package, and reboot again. You cannot run the
         <command>transactional-update</command> command multiple times without rebooting
         to add more changes to the snapshot, because that creates separate 
         independent snapshots that do not include changes from the previous snapshots.
     </para>
     <para>
         Use the <command>--continue</command> option to make as many changes as you
         want without rebooting. A separate snapshot is made each time, and each
         snapshot contains all the changes you made in the previous snapshots, plus your 
         new changes. Repeat this process as many times as you want, and when the final
         snapshot includes everything you want reboot the system, and your final snapshot
         becomes the new root file system.
     </para>
     <para>
         Another useful feature of the <command>--continue</command> option is you may
         select any existing snapshot as the base for your new snapshot. The following example
         demonstrates running <command>transactional-update</command> to install a new
         package in a snapshot based on snapshot 13, and then running it again to install 
         another package:
     </para>

    <screen>&prompt.root;<command>transactional-update --continue 13 pkg install <replaceable>package_2</replaceable></command></screen>

        The <command>--continue [num]</command> option calls <command>snapper create --from</command>.

    If the current root filesystem is identical to the active root
    filesystem (after a reboot, before <command>transactional-update</command>
    creates a new snapshot with updates), all old snapshots without a
    cleanup algorithm get a cleanup algorithm set. This ensures that old 
    snapshots will be deleted by Snapper. (See the section about cleanup 
    algorithms in snapper(8).) This also removes all unreferenced (and thus 
    unused) <filename>/etc</filename> overlay directories in

   <title>Rolling back to a specific installation state</title>
   <para>
    An initial bootable
    snapshot is created at the end of the initial system installation. You can
    go back to that state at any time by booting this snapshot. The snapshot
    can be identified by the description <literal>after installation</literal>.
   </para>
   </tip>
   <para>
   Before a rollback is performed, a snapshot of the running file system is created. The description references the ID of the snapshot that was restored in the rollback.
   </para>
   <para>
    Snapshots created by rollbacks receive the value <literal>number</literal>
    for the <literal>Cleanup</literal> attribute. The rollback snapshots are
    therefore automatically deleted when the set number of snapshots is reached.
    If the snapshot contains important data, extract the data from the snapshot
    before it is removed.

   The following procedure describes how you can perform a rollback:

   <step>
   <para>
   Choose a snapshot to boot. The snapshots are sorted according to the date of creation, the latest being the top one.
   </para>
   </step>
   <step>
   <para>
   Log in to your system and check whether everything works as expected. Bear in mind that the snapshot directories are read-only, so you cannot write into them. Data written to directories excluded from the snapshots will stay untouched.
   </para>
   </step>
   <step>
   <para>
   If the snapshot you booted into is not suitable for rollback, reboot your system and choose another one.
   </para>

   If the snapshot works as expected, you can perform rollback by running the following command:
   </para>
   <screen>

 <title>Managing automatic transactional updates</title>
 <para>
      Automatic updates are controlled by a <command>systemd.timer</command> 
      that runs once per day. This applies all updates, and informs 
      <command>rebootmgrd</command> that the machine should be rebooted. You may
      adjust the time when the update runs, see systemd.timer(5). To adjust the

 <title>Snapshots</title>
 <warning>
 <title>Snapshots are mandatory</title>
 <para>
 As snapshots are crucial for &slema; correct functioning, do not disable the feature and ensure that the root partition is big enough to store the snapshots.
 </para>
 </warning>
 <para>
 When a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to the same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not occupy additional disk space. If data in the original file system is modified, changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are kept for the snapshot.
 </para>
 <para>
 Snapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume on which the snapshot has been taken. It is not possible to store snapshots on a different partition or subvolume. As a result, partitions containing snapshots need to be larger than partitions not containing snapshots. The exact amount depends strongly on the number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data modifications. As a rule of thumb, give partitions twice as much space as you normally would. To prevent disks from running out of space, old snapshots are automatically cleaned up.

      Snapshots share data, for efficient use of storage space, so using ordinary

    Snapper does not offer custom clean-up algorithms for manually created

   <title>Adding disk quota support</title>
   <para>
    In addition to the number and/or timeline clean-up algorithms described
    above, Snapper supports quotas. You can define what percentage of the
    available space snapshots are allowed to occupy. This percentage value
    always applies to the Btrfs subvolume defined in the respective Snapper
    configuration.
   </para>
   <para> 
       Btrfs quotas are applied to subvolumes, not to users. You may apply 
       disk space quotas to users and groups (for example, with the 
       <command>quota</command> command) in addition to using Btrfs quotas.
   </para>
   <para>
      Quota support is
    automatically enabled along with Snapper.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Quotas are only activated in <emphasis>addition</emphasis> to an existing

      active, quota restrictions are not applied.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      With quota support enabled, Snapper will perform two clean-up runs if
      required. The first run will apply the rules specified for number and
      timeline snapshots. Only if the quota is exceeded after this run, the
      quota-specific rules will be applied in a second run.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>

      Even if quota support is enabled, Snapper will always keep the number of
      snapshots specified with the <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT*</literal> and
      <literal>TIMELINE_LIMIT*</literal> values, even if the quota will be
      exceeded. It is therefore recommended to specify ranged values
      (<literal><replaceable>MIN</replaceable>-<replaceable>MAX</replaceable></literal>)
      for <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT*</literal> and
      <literal>TIMELINE_LIMIT*</literal> to ensure the quota can be applied.
     </para>
     <para>
      If, for example, <literal>NUMBER_LIMIT=5-20</literal> is set, Snapper
      will perform a first clean-up run and reduce the number of regular
      numbered snapshots to 20. In case these 20 snapshots exceed the
      quota, Snapper will delete the oldest ones in a second run until the
      quota is met. A minimum of five snapshots will always be kept, regardless
      of the amount of space they occupy.
