 <para>
  &slema; raw images are delivered for the x86_64 architecture (an image with
  RT kernel is available), IBM ZSeries (an image of the KVM host, images to be
  used with FBA or DASD devices) and also AArch64. These images are intended to
  be configured on the first boot by using either Ignition or Combustion. The
  boot loader detects the first boot, see more in
  <xref linkend="sec-first-boot"/>. Each image has default mounted subvolumes
  as described in <xref linkend="sec-default-partitioning"/>. The procedure of
  deploying these images is described in
  <xref linkend="cha-images-procedure"/>.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-default-partitioning">
  <title>Default partitioning</title>

  <para>
   The raw images are delivered with a default partitioning scheme, which can
   be changed during the first boot by using Ignition or Combustion. For a
   procedure of repartitiong the system, refer to
   <xref xrefstyle="template:Ignition" linkend="sec-ignition-configuration"/>
   or <xref xrefstyle="template:Combustion" linkend="sec-combustion-script"/>.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Btrfs is mandatory for the root file system.</title>
   <para>
    Bear in mind that if you intend to perform any changes to the default
    partitioning scheme, the root file system must be btrfs.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   Each image has the following subvolumes:
  </para>

<screen>
 /home
 /root
 /opt
 /srv 
 /usr/local
 /var
 </screen>

  <para>
   The images also have mounted subvolumes for booting by default. The concrete
   subvolumes differ according to the architecture.
  </para>
  <para>
  You can recognize the subvolumes mounted by default by the option <literal>x-initrd.mount</literal> in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. Other subvolumes or partitions must be configured either by Ignition or Combustion. 
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-first-boot">
  <title>First boot detection</title>

  <para>
   The configuration runs on the first boot only. To distinquish between the
   first and subsequent boots, the flag file
   &mdash;<filename>/boot/firstboot_happened</filename> is created after the
   first boot took place. If the file is not present in the file system, the
   attribute <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> is passed to the kernel
   command line, which triggeres creating initramfs with Ignition or running
   the dracut module in case of Combustion. After completing the first boot,
   the <filename>/boot/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file is created.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>The flag file is always created</title>
   <para>
    Even though the configuration may not be successfull, due to improper or
    missing configuration files, the
    <filename>/boot/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file is created.
   </para>
   <!--JH: ADD HOW! -->
   <para>
    You may force the first boot configuration on subsequent boot by passing
    the <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> attribute to the kernel command
    line or by deleting the <filename>/boot/firstboot_happened</filename> flag
    file.
