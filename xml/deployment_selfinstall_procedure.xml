 </info>
<para>
  &productname; provides selfinstall iso images that enable you to deploy &slema; to your machine and then configure the system on the first boot.
</para>
<para>
  To prepare the setup, you need two separate devices. One device (either a physical or a virtual drive) where &slema; will run, and another device that serves as a configuration medium. 
  </para>
<para>
  To deploy the sellfinstall image, you need to prepare the configuration device as described in <xref linkend="pro-selfinstall-configuration-device"/>. The configuration device must be plugged to the host machine throughout the installation process. Then you need a disk with enough free space where &slema; will be deployed from the selfinstall iso. 
  </para>

</procedure>

<para>
  After the first boot, you need to register your &slem; instance by using the
   <command>transactional-update</command> command. For details, refer to
  <xref linkend="sec-images-registration"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  &slema; has available extension for live patching. To use this extension, you
  need to add the extension to your subscription from the installed system. For
  details, refer to <xref linkend="sec-adding-extension"/>.
